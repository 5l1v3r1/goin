Goin is a full text search indexer using https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve for your files on disk.

It can handle plain text, many different images, as well as pdf files.

It processes files based on their mime type making it fairly easy to add support
for more files in the future. It's still very much a work in progress.

goin --help will give you an overview of the flags to tweak it's operation.
